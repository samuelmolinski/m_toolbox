	 * 
	 * This is a personal collection of WordPress functions I have found to be 
	 * useful in most of my themecraft.  I have complited them into this 'toolbox
	 * to help keep them together for easy implementation.
	 * 
	 * To include this to any theme add the wp_toobox folder to your theme and 
	 * add the line "include_once('wp_toolbox/wp_toolbox.php');" inside the
	 * function.php
	 * 
	 * Most of the functions are written to use a similar nomenclature as
	 * Wordpress uses already 
	 *
